# Security Policy

## Overview

Thank you for helping to make **Fern** a secure programming language! This document outlines the process for reporting vulnerabilities and our commitment to addressing them.

Fern is currently in **early development**, and as such, features and tools may still be evolving. We encourage the community to help identify and report any security concerns to ensure a stable and secure ecosystem as the project matures.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

While Fern is in its early stages, we are still committed to addressing any security vulnerabilities responsibly. If you discover a vulnerability, please follow the steps below:

1. **Document the Issue**: Clearly describe the nature of the vulnerability, including:
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Any relevant code snippets or configurations.
   - Potential risks or impacts.

2. **Hold Off on Public Disclosure**: To ensure the issue can be fixed responsibly, we kindly ask that you refrain from publicly disclosing the details of the vulnerability until it has been resolved.

3. **Temporary Contact Method**: While we are setting up a dedicated security contact, please create a GitHub issue with the label `Security` to notify us of any concerns. Use discretion when sharing details to prevent exposing sensitive information to the public.

   _Note: A dedicated email or contact form for security issues will be set up soon. This policy will be updated once it is available._

## Our Commitment

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of vulnerability reports as soon as possible.
- **Investigation**: We will investigate all reported issues thoroughly and aim to provide updates on our progress.
- **Resolution**: We will prioritize fixes for vulnerabilities based on their severity and impact.

## Future Updates

As Fern progresses in development, this policy will be updated to include:
- A dedicated contact method for reporting vulnerabilities.
- A clearer timeline for acknowledging, investigating, and resolving issues.

Thank you for your contributions and efforts to make Fern a secure and reliable programming language!
